This repository hosts a web application that dynamically displays all the image files stored in a specified folder on a user-friendly website. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and a lightweight backend (Flask/Node.js) to fetch and render image content. Key features include:

Automatic detection of all image files (e.g., .jpg, .jpeg, .png) in the folder.
A responsive grid layout to organize and display images efficiently.
Option to add image titles or descriptions fetched from filenames or metadata.
Easy-to-deploy setup for local or remote hosting.
Perfect for creating a simple image gallery to showcase or browse media collections!
